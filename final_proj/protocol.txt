Starting by having everyone connect to coordinator using their ip/port/etc
Coord start when ready by sending everyone the connection information of who's in the game
Coord also asigns ids to players and sends list of all ids along with connection information
    Coord is merely a meeting point
Each player connects with each other player and THEN sends coord READY
Players connect to each other as follows:
    Player acts as server for all players whose position is smaller than self
    Player acts connects (as client) for each player who position is higher than self
i.e. for 4 players
Client --> Server
    1  -->  2
    1  -->  3
    1  -->  4
    2  -->  3
    2  -->  4
    3  -->  4
Coord by default is first player and each player gets a position
Actions avilable:
    2. TAKE_ACTION
        * sends action to each player and does 2PC with each of the other players
    3. END_TURN
        * next player's turn
